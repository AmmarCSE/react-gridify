# react-gridify

react-gridify is a suite of fluxious react+redux grid components. The design has a modern grid widget along with associated components such as intelligent filters and a coherent paging scheme. Components are loosely coupled and implement a unidirectional data/action flow. 

This suite is inspired by a previous, heavily fortified grid system that executed detailed and advanced functionality requirements.
