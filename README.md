# react-gridify

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/AmmarCSE/react-gridify/master/demo/react-gridify.png)

react-gridify is a suite of fluxious react+redux grid components. The design has a modern grid widget along with associated components such as intelligent filters and a coherent paging scheme. Components are loosely coupled and implement a unidirectional data/action flow. 

This suite is inspired by a previous, heavily fortified grid system that executed detailed and advanced functionality requirements.

Demo
--------------

The original demo source can be found in the `/demo` directory and uses the [browser-endpoints](https://github.com/AmmarCSE/browser-endpoints) and [local-storage-sql](https://github.com/AmmarCSE/local-storage-sql) plugins to simulate a full use-case with the `react-gridify` components. Navigate to this [CodePen](http://codepen.io/AmmarCSE/full/YWQgWb/) for a live demo experience.

<sub>*Note: This demo is not supported in IE. This is due to the use of the [browser-endpoints](https://github.com/AmmarCSE/browser-endpoints) plugin which makes extensions to the native `XMLHttpRequest` that are incompatible with IE. However, the react-gridiy extension itself is supported in IE.*</sub>
